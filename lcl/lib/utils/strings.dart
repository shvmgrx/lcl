   static const String ABOUT_US2 = "It all started with our gut instinct... We thought, \"food unites, food makes us happy!\" It\'s a passion that most of us share. We like to go out to restaurants and make delicacies for our loved ones. Some of us have a confessing sweet tooth, others follow a strict diet - avoiding animal products or carbohydrates. In short: eating has become a religion. We identify ourselves through our eating habits and celebrate this - \"you are what you eat!\" ";
   static const String ABOUT_US3 = "But in times of Corona, our everyday life has suddenly changed fundamentally - home office, lockdown, minimum distance and face masks. Lunch breaks, which we used to spend with colleagues, now take place alone in our own kitchen. With half the clique for dinner to your favourite Italian? Unfortunately impossible at the moment.And traveling is also only allowed to a limited extent. And so we indulge in memories of faraway countries and exotic dishes. At the moment we prefer to stay at home and swing the cooking spoon ourselves, bake sourdough- or banana bread. Afterwards we take a photo and share it under the hashtag #foodporn in the social networks. ";
   static const String ABOUT_US4 = "Even though the pandemic has thwarted the plans for 2020 for many of us, we don\'t let it get us down: \"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!\" Let\'s cook something delicious together! Nobody has to sit alone at the plate in these times. We want to connect people all over the world. LUNCHALIZE (lunch & socialize) is a place where foodies can sit together at a digital table - whether purely as friends or in search of the next love story. After all, the saying goes: \"Love goes through the stomach!\" Here you can share your favourite recipes, browse for soulfood from all over the world and even have lunch together with your match via video chat. With this in mind we wish you bon app√©tit - let\'s lunchalize!";
   static const String ABOUT_US5 = "There was something else... Corona also taught us that we have to stick together especially in these times - we are in this together! Most of us always have a full fridge or can quickly go to the supermarket around the corner. In other parts of the world, however, there is great poverty and many people are starving - even small children. More than 135 million people suffer painful tortures of hunger and the number is growing daily. Let us help. Let us make a small contribution and give something to those who have nothing. We are working very closely with Welthungerhilfe and would like to ask you to make a small donation for the poorest people on this planet. Because we all bear responsibility and do not want to look away. Thank you very much for your support! Sharing is caring... ";
   static const String ABOUT_US6 = "Our little startup kitchen...";
   static const String ABOUT_US7 = "The team consists of Myriam, 37, journalist and initiator of LUNCHALIZE and Shivam, 23, IT expert and caffeine to code converter. Myriam is from Hamburg with German-Irish roots and has been cooking almost every food trend in the last few years. She is a self-confessed greenie and has snacked her way through the most diverse food stalls of the world. Shivam comes from Aurangabad,India and can prepare exotic Indian cuisine. But he also likes to be inspired by international cooking shows and when it comes to juicy burgers he just can't resist. We hope you like what we serve you. But just like good cooks, we are always grateful for your suggestions and criticism.";
